I choosed to stick to NTNU's font and original logo to make it familiar to the other
pages at NTNU. I only used one accent color besides NTNU' blå to ceep the design simple.

The full screen image, I think can be read as both for design and coding, since it shows 
both computer and tablet. I also used an image of people coding in the article on the front page.
The rest i have tried to make simple and clear so both design and coding can have its own place.

I made a little scroll indication animation to show the page has more content if you scroll down.

We had to use the brakepoint at 600px screen width. I tried to make that work on everything, but
sometimes that will look weird. In a different scenario i would use different brakepoints based on
what looks good at different screen sizes.

I did not want to change the layout to much on the programmes page. It is a lot of information
and i choose to display it in a simple readable way. I made the headings uppercase since they are 
for short-names. I placed an applicate now button to link to the applicate page. This way it is 
easy to get there when you know what you want to do.

On the contact list, when you hover i have added a title so its easier to see what you can do.
The same on the social icons in the footer.

I choosed to have an assets folder containing my css, images and scripts in their respective folders.
My css is spread on a main css file and one for each page. It became a lot of css so it was much cleaner
and structured to have them in separate files. The html pages is in the main folder since there is just
4 pages. It could be more structured to have them in separate folders if there were many pages.

I am using CSS Normalize:
"Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with 
modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing."

We have not learnt about JavaScript yet, so we could borrow someone else's. I used this video on
youtube to make the js for the navbar work. I improved the html and css to the better. I dont think
he did a good work on that part.
